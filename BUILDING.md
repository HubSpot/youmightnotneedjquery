Building YMNNJQ requires Node.js

- Run: `npm install -g gulp`
- In the project directory, run `npm install`
- To build/watch, run `gulp`

Please make all changes in the jade, coffee, styl, and comparisons folders, the rest are built files.

To add a new section, just create a folder for it, and add `jquery.js`, and `ie8.js`, `ie9.js` and `ie10.js` as needed.  For example, if you have `ie8.js` and `ie9.js`, the ie9 version will be shown to people looking for a solution that works in ie9 or 10.
